    `break`
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    terminate execution of a block within your processes scope
  Description: |-
    `break` will terminate execution of a block (eg `function`, `private`,
    `foreach`, `if`, etc).

    `break` requires a parameter and that parameter is the name of the caller
    block you wish to break out of. If it is a `function` or `private`, then it
    will be the name of that function or private. If it is an `if` or `foreach`
    loop, then it will be `if` or `foreach` (respectively).
  Usage: |-
    ```
    break block-name
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    function foo {
        %[1..10] -> foreach i {
            out $i
            if { $i == 5 } then {
                out "exit running function"
                break foo
                out "ended"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    Running the above code would output:

    ```
    » foo
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    exit running function
    ```
  Flags:
  Detail: |-
    `break` cannot escape the bounds of its scope (typically the function it is
    running inside). For example, in the following code we are calling `break
    bar` (which is a different function) inside of the function `foo`:

    ```
    function foo {
        %[1..10] -> foreach i {
            out $i
            if { $i == 5 } then {
                out "exit running function"
                break bar
                out "ended"
            }
        }
    }

    function bar {
        foo
    }
    ```

    Regardless of whether we run `foo` or `bar`, both of those functions will
    raise the following error:
    
    ```
    Error in `break` (7,17): no block found named `bar` within the scope of `foo`
    ```

- DocumentID: continue
  Title: >+
    `continue`
  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    terminate process of a block within a caller function
  Description: |-
    `continue` will terminate execution of a block (eg `function`, `private`,
    `foreach`, `if`, etc) right up until the caller function. In iteration loops
    like `foreach` and `formap` this will result in behavior similar to the
    `continue` statement in other programming languages.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    continue block-name
    ```
  Examples: |-
    ```
    %[1..10] -> foreach i {
        if { $i == 5 } then {
            out "continue"
            continue foreach
            out "skip this code"
        }
        out $i
    }
    ```

    Running the above code would output:

    ```
    » foo
    1
    2
    3
    4
    continue
    6
