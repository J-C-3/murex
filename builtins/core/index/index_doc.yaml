  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Outputs an element from an array, map or table
  Description: |-
    Outputs an element or multiple elements from an array, map or table.

    Please note that indexes in _murex_ are counted from zero.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    <stdin> -> [ element ] -> <stdout>
    $variable[ element ] -> <stdout>

    <stdin> -> ![ element ] -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    Return the 2nd (1), 4th (3) and 6th (5) element in an array

    ```
    » ja [0..9] -> [ 1 3 5 ]
    [
        "1",
        "3",
        "5"
    ]
    ```

    Return the data-type and description of **config shell syntax-highlighting**

    ```
    » config -> [[ /shell/syntax-highlighting ]] -> [ Data-Type Description ]
    [
        "bool",
        "Syntax highlighting of murex code when in the interactive shell"
    ]
    ```

    Return all elements _except_ for 1 (2nd), 3 (4th) and 5 (6th)

    ```
    » a: [0..9]-> ![ 1 3 5 ]
    0
    2
    4
    6
    7
    8
    9
    ```

    Return all elements except for the data-type and description

    ```
    » config -> [[ /shell/syntax-highlighting ]] -> ![ Data-Type Description ]
    {
        "Default": true,
        "Dynamic": false,
        "Global": true,
        "Value": true
    }
    ```

  Detail: |-
    ### Index counts from zero

    Indexes in _murex_ behave like any other computer array in that all arrays
    start from zero (`0`).
    
    ### Include vs exclude
    
    As demonstrated in the examples above, `[` specifies elements to include
    where as `![` specifies elements to exclude.

    ### Don't error upon missing elements

    By default, **index** generates an error if an element doesn't exist. However
    you can disable this behavior in `config`

    ```
    » config -> [ foobar ]
    Error in `[` ((builtin) 2,11): Key 'foobar' not found
    
    » config set index silent true
    
    » config -> [ foobar ]
    ```
