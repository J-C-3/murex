  CategoryID: commands
  Summary: >-
    Glob pattern matching for file system objects (eg *.txt)
  Description: |-
    Returns a list of files and directories that match a glob pattern.

    Output is a JSON list.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    g: pattern -> <stdout>

    [ <stdin> -> ] @g command pattern [ -> <stdout> ]

    !g: pattern -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    Inline globbing:
    
    ```
    cat: @{ g: *.txt }
    ```

    Writing a JSON array of files to disk:
    
    ```
    g: *.txt -> > filelist.json
    ```

    Writing a list of files to disk:
    
    ```
    g: *.txt -> format str -> > filelist.txt
    ```

    Checking if a file exists:
    
    ```
    if { g: somefile.txt } then {
        # file exists
    }
    ```

    Checking if a file does not exist:
    
    ```
    !if { g: somefile.txt } then {
        # file does not exist
    }
    ```

    Return all files apart from text files:

    ```
    !g: *.txt
    ```

    Auto-globbing (eg for Bash compatibility):

    ```
    @g ls *.txt
    ```
  Detail: |-
    ### Pattern Reference

    * `*` matches any number of (including zero) characters
    * `?` matches any single character

    ### Auto-Globbing

    Any command prefixed with `@g` will be auto-globbed. For example, the two
    following commands will produce the same output:

    ```
    » ls @{g: *.go}
    benchmarks_test.go  defaults_test.go  flags.go  godoc.go  main.go  murex_test.go

    » @g ls: *.go
    benchmarks_test.go  defaults_test.go  flags.go  godoc.go  main.go  murex_test.go
    ```

    The rational behind the ugly `@g` syntax is simply to make one-liners a bit
    less painful when coming from more traditional POSIX-like shells (eg Bash)
    where wildcards are automatically expanded. So if you type `ls *` (for example)
    then realise you've forgotten to subshell, you can just recall the last command
    with auto-globbing enabled:
    
    ```
    @g ^!!
    ```

    ### Inverse Matches

    If you want to exclude any matches based on wildcards, rather than include
    them, then you can use the bang prefix. eg

    ```
    » g: READ*
    [
        "README.md"
    ]

    » !g: *
    Error in `!g` (1,1): No data returned.
    ```

  Summary: >-
    Regexp pattern matching for file system objects (eg '.*\.txt')
  Description: |-
    Returns a list of files and directories that match a regexp pattern.

    Output is a JSON list.
  Usage: |-
    ```
    rx: pattern -> <stdout>

    !rx: pattern -> <stdout>
    ```
  Examples: |-
    Inline regex file matching:
    
    ```
    cat: @{ rx: '.*\.txt' }
    ```

    Writing a list of files to disk:
    
    ```
    rx: '.*\.go' -> > filelist.txt
    ```

    Checking if files exist:
    
    ```
    if { rx: somefiles.* } then {
        # files exist
    }
    ```

    Checking if files do not exist:
    
    ```
    !if { rx: somefiles.* } then {
        # files do not exist
    }
    ```

    Return all files apart from text files:

    ```
    !g: '\.txt$'
    ```

    ### Traversing Directories

    Unlike globbing (`g`) which can traverse directories (eg `g: /path/*`), `rx` is
    only designed to match file system objects in the current working directory.

    `rx` uses Go (lang)'s standard regexp engine.

    ### Inverse Matches

    If you want to exclude any matches based on wildcards, rather than include
    them, then you can use the bang prefix. eg

    ```
    » rx: READ*                                                                                                                                                              
    [
        "README.md"
    ]
    
    murex-dev» !rx: .*
    Error in `!rx` (1,1): No data returned.
