Each script can be it's own module.\nie there are multiple modules that can be grouped together and distributed as a\nsingle package.\n\nThe way packages and modules are represented is as a path:\n    \n    package/module\n        \n`murex-package` is a package management tool for administrating murex modules\nand packages.\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall a new package\n\n    murex-package: install uri\n    \nUpdate all packages\n\n    murex-package: update\n    \nEnable a package or module which had been disabled\n\n    murex-package: enable package\n    \n    murex-package: enable package/module\n    \nDisable a package\n\n    murex-package: disable package\n    \n    murex-package: disable package/module\n    \nImport packages from another package database\n\n    murex-package: import [ uri/ | local/path/ ]packages.json\n    \nCheck status of murex packages\n\n    murex-package: status -> <stdout>\n\n## Flags\n\n* `disable`\n    Disables a previously enabled package or module\n* `enable`\n    Enables a previously disabled package or module\n* `import`\n    Import packages described in a backup package DB from user defined URI or local path\n* `install`\n    Installs a package from a user defined URI\n* `list`\n    Returns a list of indexed packages/modules (eg what's enabled or disabled)\n* `status`\n    Returns the version status of locally installed packages\n* `update`\n    Updates all installed packages\n\n## Detail\n\n### `murex-package: list`... `enabled` vs `loaded`\n\n`enabled` and `disabled` reads the package status from disk rather than the\npackage cache in your current _murex_ session (like `runtime` reports). This\nbecause the typical use for `murex-package list enabled|disabled` is to view\nwhich packages and modules will be loaded with any new murex session.\n\nIf you wish to view what modules are loaded in a current session then use\n`murex-package list loaded` instead. This is also equivalent to using\n`runtime --modules`.\n\n## See Also\n\n* [user-guide/Modules and packages](../user-guide/modules.md):\n  An introduction to _murex_ modules and packages\n* [user-guide/_murex_ profile files](../user-guide/profile.md):\n  A breakdown of the different files loaded on start up\n* [commands/`alias`](../commands/alias.md):\n  Create an alias for a command\n* [commands/`config`](../commands/config.md):\n  Query or define _murex_ runtime settings\n* [commands/`function`](../commands/function.md):\n  Define a function block\n* [commands/`murex-docs`](../commands/murex-docs.md):\n  Displays the man pages for _murex_ builtins\n* [commands/`private`](../commands/private.md):\n  Define a private function block\n* [commands/`runtime`](../commands/runtime.md):\n  Returns runtime information on the internal state of _murex_"
