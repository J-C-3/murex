You can obtain a FID from `fid-list`.\n\n## See Also\n\n* [commands/`bexists`](../commands/bexists.md):\n  Check which builtins exist\n* [commands/`bg`](../commands/bg.md):\n  Run processes in the background\n* [commands/`builtins`](../commands/runtime.md):\n  Returns runtime information on the internal state of _murex_\n* [commands/`exec`](../commands/exec.md):\n  Runs an executable\n* [commands/`fexec` ](../commands/fexec.md):\n  Execute a command or function, bypassing the usual order of precedence.\n* [commands/`fg`](../commands/fg.md):\n  Sends a background process into the foreground\n* [commands/`fid-kill`](../commands/fid-kill.md):\n  Terminate a running _murex_ function\n* [commands/`fid-list`](../commands/fid-list.md):\n  Lists all running functions within the current _murex_ session\n* [commands/`jobs`](../commands/fid-list.md):\n  Lists all running functions within the current _murex_ session\n* [commands/`murex-update-exe-list`](../commands/murex-update-exe-list.md):\n  Forces _murex_ to rescan $PATH looking for exectables"
