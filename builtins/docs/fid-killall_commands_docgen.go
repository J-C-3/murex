You can obtain a FID from `fid-list`.\n\n## See Also\n\n* [`bexists`](../commands/bexists.md):\n  Check which builtins exist\n* [`bg`](../commands/bg.md):\n  Run processes in the background\n* [`builtins`](../commands/runtime.md):\n  Returns runtime information on the internal state of _murex_\n* [`exec`](../commands/exec.md):\n  Runs an executable\n* [`fexec` ](../commands/fexec.md):\n  Execute a command or function, bypassing the usual order of precedence.\n* [`fg`](../commands/fg.md):\n  Sends a background process into the foreground\n* [`fid-kill`](../commands/fid-kill.md):\n  Terminate a running _murex_ function\n* [`fid-list`](../commands/fid-list.md):\n  Lists all running functions within the current _murex_ session\n* [`jobs`](../commands/fid-list.md):\n  Lists all running functions within the current _murex_ session\n* [`murex-update-exe-list`](../commands/murex-update-exe-list.md):\n  Forces _murex_ to rescan $PATH looking for exectables"
