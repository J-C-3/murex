However the braces are nestable so you will need to escape those\ncharacters if you don't want them nested.\n\n### ANSI Constants\n\n`(` supports ANSI constants.\n\n## Synonyms\n\n* `(`\n\n\n## See Also\n\n* [user-guide/ANSI Constants](../user-guide/ansi.md):\n  Infixed constants that return ANSI escape sequences\n* [commands/`>>` (append file)](../commands/greater-than-greater-than.md):\n  Writes STDIN to disk - appending contents if file already exists\n* [commands/`>` (truncate file)](../commands/greater-than.md):\n  Writes STDIN to disk - overwriting contents if file already exists\n* [commands/`cast`](../commands/cast.md):\n  Alters the data type of the previous function without altering it's output\n* [commands/`err`](../commands/err.md):\n  Print a line to the STDERR\n* [commands/`out`](../commands/out.md):\n  Print a string to the STDOUT with a trailing new line character\n* [commands/`pt`](../commands/pt.md):\n  Pipe telemetry.
