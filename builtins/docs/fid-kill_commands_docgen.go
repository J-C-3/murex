	Definition["fid-kill"] = "# _murex_ Shell Docs\n\n## Command Reference: `fid-kill`\n\n> Terminate a running _murex_ function\n\n## Description\n\n`fid-kill` will terminate a running _murex_ function in a similar way\nthat the POSIX `kill` (superficially speaking).\n\n## Usage\n\n    fid-kill fid\n\n## Detail\n\n`fid-kill` doesn't send a kernel signal to the process but since _murex_ is\na multi-threaded shell with a single signal, `fid-kill` will send a\ncancellation context to any builtins executing (which covers builtins,\naliases, public and private functions and any external executables running\nwhich were launched within the current _murex_ shell).\n\nThe FID (function ID) sent is not the same as a POSIX (eg Linux, macOS, BSD)\nPID (process ID). You can obtain a FID from `fid-list`.\n\n## See Also\n\n* [`bexists`](../commands/bexists.md):\n  Check which builtins exist\n* [`bg`](../commands/bg.md):\n  Run processes in the background\n* [`builtins`](../commands/runtime.md):\n  Returns runtime information on the internal state of _murex_\n* [`exec`](../commands/exec.md):\n  Runs an executable\n* [`fexec` ](../commands/fexec.md):\n  Execute a command or function, bypassing the usual order of precedence.\n* [`fg`](../commands/fg.md):\n  Sends a background process into the foreground\n* [`fid-killall`](../commands/fid-killall.md):\n  Terminate _all_ running _murex_ functions\n* [`fid-list`](../commands/fid-list.md):\n  Lists all running functions within the current _murex_ session\n* [`jobs`](../commands/fid-list.md):\n  Lists all running functions within the current _murex_ session\n* [`murex-update-exe-list`](../commands/murex-update-exe-list.md):\n  Forces _murex_ to rescan $PATH looking for exectables"
