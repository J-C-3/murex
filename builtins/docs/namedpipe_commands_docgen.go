While this does add overhead the advantage is this new\nwrapper can be used as a primitive for channelling any data from one point to\nanother.\n\n_murex_ named pipes are where these pipes are created in a global store,\ndecoupled from any executing functions, named and can then be used to pass\ndata along asynchronously.\n\nFor example\n\n    pipe: example\n    \n    bg {\n        <example> -> match: Hello\n    }\n    \n    out: \"foobar\"        -> <example>\n    out: \"Hello, world!\" -> <example>\n    out: \"foobar\"        -> <example>\n    \n    !pipe: example\n    \nThis returns `Hello, world!` because `out` is writing to the **example** named\npipe and `match` is also reading from it in the background (`bg`).\n\nNamed pipes can also be inlined into the command parameters with `<>` tags\n\n    pipe: example\n    \n    bg {\n        <example> -> match: Hello\n    }\n    \n    out: <example> \"foobar\"\n    out: <example> \"Hello, world!\"\n    out: <example> \"foobar\"\n    \n    !pipe: example\n    \n> Please note this is also how `test` works.\n\n_murex_ named pipes can also represent network sockets, files on a disk or any\nother read and/or write endpoint. Custom builtins can also be written in Golang\nto support different abstractions so your _murex_ code can work with those read\nor write endpoints transparently.\n\nTo see the different supported types run\n\n    runtime --pipes\n    \n### Namespaces and usage in modules and packages\n\nPipes created via `pipe` are created in the global namespace. This allows pipes\nto be used across different functions easily however it does pose a risk with\nname clashes where _murex_ named pipes are used heavily. Thus is it recommended\nthat pipes created in modules should be prefixed with the name of its package.\n\n## Synonyms\n\n* `(murex named pipe)`\n* `<>`\n* `read-named-pipe`\n\n\n## See Also\n\n* [commands/`<stdin>` ](../commands/stdin.md):\n  Read the STDIN belonging to the parent code block\n* [commands/`a` (mkarray)](../commands/a.md):\n  A sophisticated yet simple way to build an array or list\n* [commands/`bg`](../commands/bg.md):\n  Run processes in the background\n* [commands/`ja` (mkarray)](../commands/ja.md):\n  A sophisticated yet simply way to build a JSON array\n* [commands/`pipe`](../commands/pipe.md):\n  Manage _murex_ named pipes\n* [commands/`runtime`](../commands/runtime.md):\n  Returns runtime information on the internal state of _murex_\n* [parser/namedpipe](../parser/namedpipe.md):\n  "
