    The feature comes with spellchecking, inlined images, smarter syntax completion and more
  Description: |-
    This release seems some major upgrade to the default experience:

    * inlined spellchecking enabled by default (requires `aspell` installed)
    * support for inlining images enabled by default (was previously an external
      module: https://github.com/lmorg/murex-module-open-image)
    * massively overhauled syntax completion
    * rewritten config backend which copies less data around
    * significantly more features documented (see https://murex.rocks)
    * plus this new blog!
