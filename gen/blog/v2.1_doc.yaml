  Summary: >-
    This release comes with support for inlining SQL and some major bug fixes plus
    a breaking change for `config`. Please read for details.
  Description: |-
    This release seems new optional features plus major bug fixes to the existing
    code base:

    * Two `config` **shell** keys have changed names:
    
      * recursive-soft-timeout => `autocomplete-soft-timeout`
      * recursive-hard-timeout => `autocomplete-hard-timeout`

      This is to better describe their functionality now that those values are
      also used for `Dynamic` and `DynamicDesc` autocompletions as well as
      recursive directory lookups.

      **This change might break some of your existing profile config!**

    * `config` **shell** **max-suggestions** now defaults at `12` rather than 6

    * New optional builtin, `select`, allows you to inline SQL queries against
      any tabulated output (eg `ps -fe`, jsonlines arrays, CSV files, etc)

    * Stopping jobs via `^z` has been fixed in UNIX. This was a regression bug
      introduced a while back however no tests were in place to catch it.
      Unfortunately this kind of testing would fall outside of unit testing each
      function so I'll need to add another layer of testing against the compiled
      executable to verify any future regressions like these: [discussion](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/318)

    * Rewritten how `Dynamic` autocompletions are executed to fall in line with
      `DynamicDesc`. This should bring improvements to running autocompletions
      in the background and thus improve the user experience with regards to the
      shell's responsiveness. The next step would be to have a lower soft-timeout

    * Improvements to the context completions

    * All dependencies have been updated, pinned and the `vendors` directory
      rebuilt

    * Fixed some issues flagged up in [goreportcard.com](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/lmorg/murex)
  
    * Default lengths for autocompletions where all results are deferred to the
      background have been tweaked slightly to give some extra length

    * Website tweaks
