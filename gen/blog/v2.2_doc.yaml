  Summary: >-
    This is mainly a bug fix release but it does include one breaking change for
    `config`. Please read for details.
  Description: |-
    This release sees new optional features plus major bug fixes to the existing
    code base:

    ### Breaking Changes:
    
    One `config` **shell** key has changed it's name:
    
    * spellcheck-block -> `spellcheck-func`

    This is to bring spellcheck inline with other keys that contain executable
    code.

    **This change might break some of your existing profile config!**

    ### User Facing Changes:

    * Windows coreutils no longer returns exit code of 13 for aliases 

    * Fixed regression bug in fg

    * stdstream.SetDataType() only works on first call -- ignored thereafter

    * Generic data type, `*`, now uses tabwriter to align columns

    * Spellchecker error handling tweaked to be more user friendly

    * Environmental variables can been created per command:
      
    ```
    Â» env <env:foo=bar> | grep foo
    foo=bar
    ```

    ### Non-User Facing / Maintenance Changes

    * All dependencies have been updated, pinned and the `vendors` directory
      rebuilt

    * Fixed some issues flagged up in [goreportcard.com](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/lmorg/murex)

    * Some internal API changes that have no UI/UX ramifications but makes the
      code more maintainable

    * Lots more unit tests added

    * Lots of code rewritten to avoid potential data races
