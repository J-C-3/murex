    Array (`@`) Token
  CategoryID: parser
  Summary: >-
    Expand values as an array
  Description: |-
    The array token is used to tell _murex_ to expand the string as multiple
    parameters (an array) rather than as a single parameter string.
  Examples: |-
    ```
    » set: example="foo\nbar"
    
    » out: $example
    foo
    bar
    
    » out: @example
    foo bar
    ```

    In this example the second command is passing **foo\nbar** (`\n` escaped as a new
    line) to `out`. The third command is passing an array of two values: **foo** and
    **bar**.

    The array token can also work for subshells

    ```
    » out: @{ ja: [Mon..Fri] }
    Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri
    ```
  Detail: |-
    Since arrays are expanded over multiple parameters, you cannot expand an array
    inside quoted strings like you can with a string variable:

    ```
    » out: "foo ${ ja: [1..5] } bar"
    foo ["1","2","3","4","5"] bar
    
    » out: "foo @{ ja: [1..5] } bar"
    foo  1 2 3 4 5  bar

    » (${ ja: [1..5] })
    ["1","2","3","4","5"]   

    » (@{ ja: [1..5] })                                                                                                                                                                                        ~/go/src/github.com/lmorg/murex » (@{ja [1..5]})
    @{ ja: [1..5] } 
    ```
