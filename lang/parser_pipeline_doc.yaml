    Overview of what a "pipeline" is
  Description: |-
    In the _murex_ docs you'll over hear the term "pipeline". This refers to any
    commands sequenced together.

    A pipeline can be joined via any pipe token (eg `|`, `->`, `=>`, `?`). But,
    for the sake of documentation, a pipeline might even be a solitary command.
  Examples: |-
    Typical _murex_ pipeline:

    ```
    open: example.json -> [[ /node/0 ]]
    ```

    Example of a single command pipeline:

    ```
    top
    ```

    Pipeline you might see in Bash / Zsh (this is also valid in _murex_):

    ```
    cat names.txt | sort | uniq
    ```

    Pipeline filtering out a specific error from `example-cmd`

    ```
    example-cmd ? grep: "File not found"
    ```
