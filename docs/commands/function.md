## Command Reference: `function`

> Define a function block

## Description

`function` defines a block of code as a function

## Usage

    function: name { code-block }
    
    !function: command

## Examples

    » function hw { out "Hello, World!" }
    » hw
    Hello, World!
    
    » !function hw
    » hw
    exec: "hw": executable file not found in $PATH

## Detail

### Allowed characters

Function names can only include any characters apart from dollar (`$`).
This is to prevent functions from overwriting variables (see the order of
preference below).

### Undefining a function

Like all other definable states in _murex_, you can delete a function with
the bang prefix (see the example above).

### Order of preference

There is an order of precedence for which commands are looked up:
1. `test` and `pipe` functions because they alter the behavior of the compiler
2. Aliases - defined via `alias`. All aliases are global
3. _murex_ functions - defined via `function`. All functions are global
4. private functions - defined via `private`. Private's cannot be global and
   are scoped only to the module or source that defined them. For example, You
   cannot call a private function from the interactive command line
5. variables (dollar prefixed) - declared via `set` or `let`
6. auto-globbing prefix: `@g`
7. murex builtins
8. external executable files
