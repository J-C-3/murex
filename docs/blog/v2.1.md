## What's new in murex v2.1

This release seems new optional features plus major bug fixes to the existing
code base:

* Two `config` **shell** keys have changed names:

  * recursive-soft-timeout => `autocomplete-soft-timeout`
  * recursive-hard-timeout => `autocomplete-hard-timeout`

  This is to better describe their functionality now that those values are
  also used for `Dynamic` and `DynamicDesc` autocompletions as well as
  recursive directory lookups.

  **This change might break some of your existing profile config!**

* `config` **shell** **max-suggestions** now defaults at `12` rather than 6

* New optional builtin, `select`, allows you to inline SQL queries against
  any tabulated output (eg `ps -fe`, jsonlines arrays, CSV files, etc)

* Stopping jobs via `^z` has been fixed in UNIX. This was a regression bug
  introduced a while back however no tests were in place to catch it.
  Unfortunately this kind of testing would fall outside of unit testing each
  function so I'll need to add another layer of testing against the compiled
  executable to verify any future regressions like these: [discussion](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/318)

* Rewritten how `Dynamic` autocompletions are executed to fall in line with
  `DynamicDesc`. This should bring improvements to running autocompletions
  in the background and thus improve the user experience with regards to the
  shell's responsiveness. The next step would be to have a lower soft-timeout

* Improvements to the context completions

* All dependencies have been updated, pinned and the `vendors` directory
  rebuilt

* Fixed some issues flagged up in [goreportcard.com](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/lmorg/murex)

* Default lengths for autocompletions where all results are deferred to the
  background have been tweaked slightly to give some extra length

* Website tweaks
