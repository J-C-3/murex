This release seems some major upgrade to the default experience:

* inlined spellchecking enabled by default (requires `aspell` installed)
* support for inlining images enabled by default (was previously an external
  module: https://github.com/lmorg/murex-module-open-image)
* massively overhauled syntax completion
* rewritten config backend which copies less data around
* significantly more features documented (see https://murex.rocks)
* plus this new blog!
