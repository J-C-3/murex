# Language Guide: Variables And Evaluation

## OS env var vs Murex variables

OS environmental variables and Murex local variables are both recalled
the same way:

    # output
    $varname -> command

    # inlined
    command "$varname"

    # evaluated
    = varname==`value`

If a Murex variable shares the same name as an OS env var, then the
Murex variable will take precedence. eg

    # define OS env var
    out murex-var -> set example
    out os-env-var -> export example

    out $example
    # returns "murex-var"

    env | grep example
    # returns "example=os-env-var"

It is recommended that you use UPPERCASE to define OS env vars and
lowercase to define Murex variables. However you can use this feature
to override the env vars at a local level if needed.

Please note that because the Murex variables are only local, they will
not affect the `PATH` lookup, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` et al, nor be forwarded
to any external processes (eg invoked via `exec`).

## Defining a variable

It's easier to think of variables as three major classes:

1. Numeric data types:
 * `number` (default type for numeric data. Always stored as a `float`)
 * `integer`
 * `float`

2. Textual data types:
 * `string`
 * `json` (including objects)
 * `csv`
 * `code blocks` (code that will be parsed by a subshell)
 * `binary` (used when passing things like gzipped files through pipes)

3. System types:
 * `generic` (an support any data type)
 * `null` (no data supported or returned)
 * `boolean` (more of a "data state" than a type as both numeric and
   textual types can be described as `boolean`)
 * `die` (this type kills the shells. Generally only used to stop
   processing in the event of a serious and unhandled error)

## Declaring a variable

System variables cannot be declared (albeit `boolean` and `generic` types
can be handled. More on that later.

Numbers are declared with `let` and strings with `set`.

### Declaring a number

`let` supports mathematical operations, for example

    let percent=(7/10)*100

will declare a variable called `percent` and assign it the value of the
formula `(7/10)*100`.

### Declaring a string

Strings are declared via `set` with the input being added without any
evaluation. For example

    set formula=(7/10)*100

will create a variable called `formula` with the value being the string
`(7/10)*100` (ie the formula stored as text rather than the calculation
of the formula).

## Variable usage in common functions and methods

Like with many other shells and some scripting languages (eg AWK, Bash,
Perl and PHP), this shell supports inlining variables via the dollar
prefix. eg

    set a=world
    echo "Hello $a" # outputs: Hello world

Currently this is only supported in function parameters (ie you cannot
use variables as function names).
