# _murex_ Change Log

## What's new in murex v4.0

Breaking Changes:

* `$PWD` is no longer a `str`. If you need to parse `$PWD` as a string then you should `out: $PWD` or use `${pwd}`

* `.` is now a valid bareword character for variables. This will break any instances in code that contain something like `out $hello.` however you can now use `out $(hello).` syntax for safer string infixing

Features:

* dot notation added for variables which allow accessing and writing to object properties. eg `$json.array.index`

* added support variable encapsulation via `$()` to avoid variable barewords from leaking into other values when infixed. eg `$(foobar)` is the same as `$foobar`

* variable names can now be Unicode, eg `$(比如) = "举手之劳就可以使办公室更加环保，比如，使用再生纸。"`

* Unicode wide characters are properly handled in readline

* new data type `path` that is an object

* new data type `paths`

* support for lambdas added 

* readline `[ctrl]`+`[f]` now supports word matching as well as regexp

* readline `[ctrl]`+`[f]` now supports glob filters (eg `*.txt`) too

* `$ENV` and `$GLOBAL` objects (deprecates the need for `global` and `export`)

* improved error messages in expressions

* scalars can be used as assignees in expressions, eg `$foo = "bar"`

* added `-i` flag to ssh autocompletion

* readline prompts are now buffered to reduce cursor flickering

Non-User Facing / Maintenance Changes:

* backend support added for data types to be dynamic objects

Bug Fixes:

* better wide character support in auto completion suggestions

* function parameters default and comment fields are no longer order dependent

* better string parsing for barewords inside arrays and objects

* ahead of time hint caching now done on demand per hint page rather than against every executable upon _murex_ start up

* new lines should be ignored in `%{}`

* bareword `true` and `false` should be converted to boolean in `%{}`

* autocomplete suggestions are now dedup'ed when delayed results return similar suggestions to fast results

* various preview pane bug fixes

* support for ANSI escape sequences in experimental (disabled by default) TTY buffer

* correction to `count` docs
