# _murex_ Change Log

## What's new in murex v2.4

Features:
  * `alter` now supports `--sum` where structures are merged and numeric values are added together
  * New builtin `count`. This has deprecated `len` however `len` will stick around as an alias for backwards compatibility
  * New operators added to `let`: `+=`, `-=`, `/=`, `*=`
  * New builtin `addheading` for adding headings to lists
  * Compiled profile will now always execute even if _murex_ flags set to ignore the modules/user profile. This is so that aliases like `len` get set and thus _murex_ can still move forward with changes to builtins but without breaking backwards compatibility
  * `autocomplete` now passes `ISMETHOD` variable to dynamic completions so those dynamic completions are aware if a command requesting auto-completion suggestions is being invoked as a method (mid-pipeline) or function (start of a pipeline)
  * Dynamic auto-completions that include `@IncFiles` or `@IncDirs` will now automatically append files and/or directories to their auto-completion suggestions
  * New `autocomplete` directives: `IncExeAll` (like `IncExePath` but includes builtins, functions, aliases), `IncManPage` (include results from the `man` page parser -- usually suppressed when `autocomplete` config is set)
  * Disabled 'Loading default profile' message -- this was always pretty redundant but now that the compiled profile is being loaded all the time (eg `murex -c 'command'` or when called in a shebang), it's also now ugly too
  * `select` now supports passing a file in the **FROM** syntax. eg `select * FROM ./example.csv`. The caveat here is this breaks currently auto-complete on column names
  * `select` now supports multiple tables using either named pipes (eg `select * FROM <table1>, <table2>`) or variables (eg `select * FROM \$table1, \$table2`) passed in the **FROM** syntax. Variables should be escaped and you cannot mix and match between named pipes, file names nor variables. You can use any number of tables from 1 to 2^63-1 (64bit systems) or 1 to 2^31-1 (32bit systems). Which should be more than enough ;)
  * `config` option for `select` to define default output data type where multiple tables are imported
  * Lots of new and updated documentation!

  Non-user facing changes (internal changes to the _murex_ code base):
  * `open` functions can now be called by other functions to take advantage of auto-typing and auto gunzip etc.
  * `tmp.Close()` should return `err`. This isn't a bug but it might catch future bugs
  * `LazyJson` created to speed up writing tests against data structures
  * `utils/List` package created to handle list / array / map functions. Also makes testing more complex routines easier

  Bug fixes:
  * Regression bug fixed where `prepend` was invoking `append`
  * `streams.ReadCloser` not setting context
  * `parameters.StringArray()` should copy values instead of a pointer to ensure the underlying parameters are immutable
