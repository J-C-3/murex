# _murex_ Change Log

## What's new in murex v2.4

There are a number of new features in this release

### Breaking Changes:

* mkarray (`a` et al) no longer returns an error if the start and end ranges
  are the same. Instead it returns an array of 1 value.

### User Facing Changes:

* Strict variables now supported (like `set -u` in Bash). This will mean any
  variables passed that haven't been initialized beforehand will cause that
  pipeline to fail. Currently this is opt in, a future release of _murex_ will
  flip that and make it opt out. So take this opportunity to enable it in your
  `~/.murex_profile` and test your scripts. Enable this via `config`:

  <pre><code>config: set proc strict-vars true
  </code></pre>

  This feature was requested in [issue #380](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/380).

* New builtin: `datetime`. This builtin allows you to convert date and/or time
  strings of one format into strings of another format. `datetime` is a
  supercharged alternative to the UNIX command `date` aimed at making scripting
  easier.

* mkarray (`a` et al) now supports dates. eg `[01-Jan-20..05-May-21]`. If no
  start nor end date appears then mkarray assumes range starts or ends at
  current date.

* `openagent` profile for `image` data types has been improved. _murex_ now
  better supports tmux and iTerm2.

* `runtime --config` now displays `FileRef` for every `set` as well as `define`,
  named `FileRefSet` and `FileRefDefine` respectively. So you can now easily
  trace where global config is being set and defined.
   
* Better error messages in the interactive terminal.

* Prompt now defaults to only displaying current directory rather than the full
  path. You can revert this change by adding your own prompt in `config`. eg:

  <pre><code>config: set shell prompt {
      out "{RESET}{YELLOW}${pwd_short} {RESET}» "
  }

  config: set shell prompt-multiline {
      let len = ${pwd_short -> wc -c} - 1
      printf "%${$len}s » " $linenum
  }
  </code></pre>

* Parser updated to better support multiline pipelines where the newline is
  escaped and a comment exists after [issue #379](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/379).
  This only applies to shell scripts, the interactive terminal hasn't yet been
  updated to reflect this change.

* Fixed regression bugs with autocomplete parameters that affected some dynamic
  blocks.

* `readline` now caches syntax highlighting and hint text to improve the
  responsiveness of the interactive terminal. This is set to a hard limit of
  200 cached items however that will be a configurable metric in a future
  release. Also planned for the future is caching autocompletion suggestions.

* Loading message added for the default profile, ie the one that is compiled
  into and thus shipped with _murex_.

* Fixed bug with `fid-list` and `jobs` where they were outputting the `p.Name`
  struct rather than `p.Name.String()`. This lead to the process name appearing
  garbled under some circumstances.

* `{BG-BLUE}` emitted the wrong ANSI escape code, this has been corrected.

* `readline` bug fixes.

### Non-User Facing / Maintenance Changes

* Thread safe copying of parameters upon fork. The previous code never actually
  generated any race conditions and I don't think ever could. However it was
  ambiguous. This new code makes the copy more explicit and appears to have
  also brought some minor performance improvements in benchmarks too.

* Behavioural test framework has been refactored to make it easier to add new
  behavioural tests.

* Lots of new tests added.

* Updated documentation.
