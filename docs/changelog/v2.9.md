# _murex_ Change Log

## What's new in murex v2.9

Breaking Changes:

* None

Features:

* Support for automatic globbing in the commandline. This has to be enabled via `config: set shell auto-glob true`

* Dynamic autocomplete suggestions are now cached for 5 seconds by default. This cache can be changed via the **CacheTTL** directive in `autocomplete`

* New reserved variable `$PWD` (this was just a global variable previously)



Minor Changes:

* Unmatched records in **index** (`[`) when parsing a table now produces the same configurable behavior (erroring by default but which can be disabled) as when using **index** against an object

* Autocompletion suggestions for `yarn`

* Data-type field in `function` is now optional

* Lots of improvements to the docs

Bug Fixes:

* `$MyVar[[/path/to/element]]` now behaves the same when used infixed as it did when used as a function
